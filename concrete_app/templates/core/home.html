                    The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured 
                    using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete 
                    is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test 
                    strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and 
                    effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we 
                    need for acceptable compressive strength.
